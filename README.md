### ReadMe for "A methodologically robust seasonal snow densification function from Soviet North Pole drifting station data"

This repository contains the original snow density file that I received from the NSIDC in November 2019, based on the contents of a CD they had. It's DENSITY.DAT.

I've put the data into a spreadsheet for easier analysis: transect_densities.xlsx

Code to analyse the spreadsheet and produce the manuscript's figure is in Density_evolution.ipynb
