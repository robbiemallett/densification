Snow density measurements are contained in DENSITY.DAT. This file can be downloaded from the Joint US-Russian Sea Ice Atlas (Environmental Working Group, 2000).

I've put the density data into a spreadsheet for easier analysis: transect_densities.xlsx

Code to analyse the spreadsheet and produce the manuscript's figure is in Density_evolution.ipynb
