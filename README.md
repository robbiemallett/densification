### ReadMe for "A methodologically robust seasonal snow densification function from Soviet North Pole drifting station data"

Snow density measurements are contained in DENSITY.DAT. This file can be downloaded from the Joint US-Russian Sea Ice Atlas (Environmental Working Group, 2000).

I've put the data into a spreadsheet for easier analysis: transect_densities.xlsx

Code to analyse the spreadsheet and produce the manuscript's figure is in Density_evolution.ipynb
